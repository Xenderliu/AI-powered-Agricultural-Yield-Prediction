# Title: AI-powered Agricultural Yield Prediction
# Description: Utilize ML and satellite imagery to predict crop yields and optimize resource allocation for farmers in developing countries.

# This demo code outlines a simple approach to predicting agricultural yields using satellite imagery and machine learning.
# The code is structured as follows:
# 1. Data Preprocessing: Load and preprocess satellite images.
# 2. Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from the preprocessed images.
# 3. Model Training: Train a machine learning model using the extracted features.
# 4. Prediction: Use the trained model to predict crop yields.
# 5. Optimization: Suggest resource allocation based on predictions.

# Note: This is a conceptual demo. In a real-world scenario, you would need access to satellite imagery data,
# and the model's accuracy would depend on the quality and quantity of the data.

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from skimage.io import imread
from skimage.transform import resize
import os
import glob

# Step 1: Data Preprocessing
# Assuming satellite images are stored in a folder named 'satellite_images'
# and there's a CSV file 'yield_data.csv' containing labels for each image.

def load_images_and_labels(image_folder, label_csv):
    """
    Load satellite images and their corresponding yield labels.
    """
    images = []
    labels = pd.read_csv(label_csv)
    for filepath in glob.glob(os.path.join(image_folder, '*.jpg')):
        # Extract image ID from the file name
        image_id = os.path.basename(filepath).split('.')[0]
        # Read and preprocess the image
        image = imread(filepath)

        # Match images to their labels
    labels = labels[labels['image_id'].isin(images)].reset_index(drop=True)
    return np.array(images), labels['yield'].values

# Step 2: Feature Extraction
# For simplicity, this demo will not cover detailed feature extraction from satellite images.
# In practice, you might use techniques like NDVI calculation, texture analysis, etc.

# Step 3: Model Training
def train_model(X, y):
    """
    Train a machine learning model using RandomForestRegressor.
    """
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
    model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    print(f"Model Training Accuracy: {model.score(X_test, y_test)*100:.2f}%")
    return model

# Step 4: Prediction
def predict_yield(model, image):
    """
    Predict the yield of a crop using a trained model.
    """
    image = resize(image, (128, 128)).reshape(1, -1)
    return model.predict(image)

# Step 5: Optimization
# Based on the predictions, we can suggest optimal resource allocation.
# This could involve a separate optimization model that considers factors like water availability, soil quality, etc.

# Main workflow
if __name__ == "__main__":
    image_folder = 'satellite_images'
    label_csv = 'yield_data.csv'
    images, labels = load_images_and_labels(image_folder, label_csv)
    images_flattened = images.reshape(images.shape[0], -1)  # Flatten images for RandomForestRegressor
    model = train_model(images_flattened, labels)
    # Example prediction
    # predict_yield(model, images[0])

# Note: This code is intended as a starting point and will need modifications to run in a specific environment.
# It also simplifies many aspects of the machine learning pipeline for clarity and brevity.
